            Nearly half of American households are burdened by rent, spending
            more than 30% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads.
            We believe everyone deserves a home that brings them happiness and
            security, whatever &quot;home&quot; means to you. By embracing
            innovative, practical, and creative solutions, we&apos;re tackling
            the housing crisis head-onâ€”empowering individuals to reclaim freedom
            and redefine the American Dream.
